👋 Hello there, I’m Utkarsh, and welcome to my personal portfolio website. Currently pursuing my master’s degree in Data Science and Analytics at the University of Leeds, UK, I am deeply passionate about leveraging data-driven insights📉 to solve complex problems and drive innovation. I have a keen interest in exploring the intersections of data science with various domains, including healthcare, finance, and technology. My academic journey has equipped me with advanced skills in statistical analysis, machine learning, and data visualization, which I apply to extract meaningful patterns from data and deliver actionable recommendations.

Beyond my academic pursuits, I enjoy exploring new cultures through travel✈️, immersing myself in strategic challenges through gaming🎮, and unwinding with compelling narratives in movies🎞️. These experiences enrich my perspective and creativity, contributing to my holistic approach in problem-solving.
